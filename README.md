# Background
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of smart health devices for women. They have tasked you with analyzing their device usage data and provide recommendations to the marketing team.

# The Ask Phase
The purpose of data analytics is to uncover patterns from the data gathered and to make business decisions based on those patterns identified. But, in order to do this, we must define the problem statement.

💡 **BUSINESS TASK: Analyze Fitbit data to gain insight and help guide marketing strategy for Bellabeat to grow as a global player.**

Primary stakeholders: Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, executive team members.

Secondary stakeholders: Bellabeat marketing analytics team.

## The Preprare Phase

Data Source: 30 participants FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from Mobius: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit. The dataset has 18 CSV files. 

The ROCCC analysis:
The data is Reliable and Original. However, the sample size is 30. There are a lot of inconsistencies and errors. The weight CSV file is incomplete and has data only for few people. The dataset is recorded for a period of 1 month in 2016. The data is not current. 

## The Process Phase

I did the following preprocessing steps on the data in an Excel Sheet using PowerQuery:

- Removed Duplicates
- Consistent Naming across different files
- Checked for data types of all columns
- Created a new column to calculate Average time in Bed not asleep using existing columns
- Merged all relevant data into a single file and named it the "final_df"
